		We have used various open source tools including three.js, react three fiber and html 
		to name a few. His skill level and expertise is second to none and he is the upmost 
		professional with business interactions and the process of solving problems. Always a 
		gentleman and a pleasure to work with, I genuinely enjoy working with Tony and always 
		look forward to our projects together."`,

    text: `"I've worked with Tony for many years, but our most recent project was a web 
		application that was used to successfully deliver three clinical trials. Tony's work was 
		robust enough to be accredited by a clinical trials unit, which is a success in itself, 
		and he worked flexibly and responsibly with a graphic design to produce a web application 
		that was highly usable for people with disabilities. Thoroughly recommended."`,
